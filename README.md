======================================================
As the luigi README said, "Luigi is a Python module that helps you build
complex pipelines of batch jobs. It handles dependency resolution,
workflow management, visualization etc.", dependencies install is
awesome!

Related to [homebrew](http://http://brew.sh/)
======================================================
Homebrew is a package manager for OS X, and there's also a fork version
called [linuxbrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew). They are both
written in Ruby, and `brewup` want to directly use their package
informations, so `brewup` need to be written in Ruby too.
